Create an SSH key pair on your computer with ssh-keygen.

ssh-keygen 
After running this command, you should see the following prompt:

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/your_home/.ssh/id_rsa):

You have created a public and private key pair. To view your public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

---

SSH to the server and create the .ssh directory, if it doesn’t already exist:

mkdir -p ~/.ssh
Add the public key from step 1 to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. Replace public_key with the contents of id_rsa.pub from step 1.

echo public_key >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Log out of the server, then log back in:

ssh root@1.2.3.4

---

Your SSH key-based authentication is configured, but password authentication is still active. To change this you need to make some changes to the file sshd_config which is located in /etc/ssh directory. You can open that file with this command:

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
In the file, you need to find and change several lines Permit Root Login should be set to yes

...
PermitRootLogin   yes
...
Password Authentication should be set to no

...
PasswordAuthentication  no
...
Challenge-Response Authentication should be set to no

...
ChallengeResponseAuthentication  no
...  
Using of Password Authentication Method (PAM) should be set to yes

...
UsePAM yes
...
After making these changes, press ESC and then :WQ. For this change to take effect, restart the sshd service:

sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
Before closing your terminal, open a new terminal window and run this command

ssh root@1.2.3.4
